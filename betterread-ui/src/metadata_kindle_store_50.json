    "description":"Madoc Tamlin is a man with an unusual problem. He wakes to find himself a thousand years in the future, in a space station on the far side of the sun. Or so he is told by the mysterious, sexless human who greets him. Madoc assures himself that he's still in his own time, trapped in advanced virtual reality by one of his foes, because if he isn't, he has no idea why he was cryogenically frozen--which would mean that he was a dangerous criminal. And he doesn't remember that either! Plus, the notorious serial killer Christine Caine has been defrosted to join him, and they, along with their strange rescuer, have just been captured in an impossible space battle by an unknown enemy.The Omega Expeditionis the sixth and concluding volume of Brian Stableford's grand future history, which explores the possibilities and perils of emortality  (near-immortality). This is one of the most thoughtful, complex, and ambitious series ever produced in science fiction, and its final novel, a standalone work, masterfully orchestrates the numerous characters, themes, plot lines, and ideas to a bold conclusion. But newcomers to the series really shouldn't start withThe Omega Expedition. Read the novels of this future history in the author's intended order, detailed in his informative introduction toThe Omega Expedition. Start withThe Cassandra Complex.--Cynthia Ward"

    "description":"Retired physicist and amateur gumshoe Dr. Gloria Lamerino returns in Minichino's fifth murder-by-the-elements mystery (The Hydrogen Murder, etc.), a largely inert mix of chemistry and crime. Though she's comfortably settled in her hometown of Revere, Mass., and relishing the affections of Matt Gennaro, a local homicide detective with &#x22;Al Pacino eyes,&#x22; Gloria can't seem to keep her nose out of sleuthing. When John Galigani, the son of her beloved landlords, is accused of murdering a former girlfriend, Yolanda Fiore, Gloria's on the case to prove John's innocence faster than you can say &#x22;periodic table.&#x22; Although Matt has to recuse himself because of his friendship with the Galigani family, he helps sift through clues and Lamerino's hypotheses. Was Yolanda killed because her newsletter Raid-iation exposed falsified data in Japan? Did her death stem from conflict over a questionable library expansion plan? Or did Yolanda uncover clues about a 55-year-old murder? Descriptions of boron as a neutron poison, radioactive wastes, Italian food and characters' fashion choices serve more often to slow than advance the plot. In addition, readers may find themselves lost amid generations of Italian names in this highly populated novel. Reading Yolanda's e-mails, Lamerino decides, must be like wading through something by Mario Puzo. But there's no denying the flair in Minichino's portrait of Italian Americans, or the charm of her energetic, quick-thinking heroine, who seeks both love and justice.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.",

    "description":"The only segment of aviation that currently has a rising accident trend is general aviation. GA is also the only segment that does not emphasize being &#x22;in command.&#x22; Instead, GA training has traditionally focused on rote execution of flight maneuvers. New studies reveal a proactive approach to general aviation flight operations successfully improves general aviation accident odds. Based on FAA-mandated pilot-in-command authority and responsibility for flight safety and operations, Pilots in Command: Strategic Action Plan for Reducing &#x22;Pilot Error&#x22; provides private pilots a how-to guide to cockpit decision making. Using a step-by-step model, pilots discover how to use available tools to avoid pilot error. The book also identifies inherent pilot habits commonly practiced by general aviation pilots and presents methods for self-retraining to eliminate the problematic behaviors. General Aviation training is changing to meet the facts of rising accident trends and subsequent investigation into its origins and prevention. The strategies Craig presents inPilot in Commandare developed from FAA-participated research and continued review. It is effective decision making that produces effective flight, and Craig expertly weds the two in a hands-on approach pilots can apply every time they fly.",

    "description":"The prolific cleric plops his psychic singer heroine and her family into a delicious stew of trouble in his latest crowd pleaser. The &#x22;fey&#x22; Nuala (last seen in 2001's Irish Love) senses that self-made Chicago lawyer and tough guy Seamus Costelloe is doomed after meeting him at a Milan music festival. Nuala persuades her beloved husband, Dermot, that they must find out why in time to prevent tragedy. Back in the Windy City, Dermot pursues the true cause of the century-old Haymarket Riot, while Nuala gives premature birth to their latest angel, Socra Marie, who has to spend several weeks in the neonatal ICU. Dermot does much of the legwork as Nuala recuperates and focuses on the baby, though her maternal duties don't stop her from running the show. The immigrant condition is very much on their minds, in both past and present investigations, and even life at home is affected by the hardships and prejudices encountered by new arrivals, especially in ethnically complex Chicago. There's a lot to keep straight in this one. When he isn't trying to help Nuala save Costelloe, Dermot is reading transcripts of the Haymarket trial and period newspaper articles, especially those penned by journalist Ned Fitzpatrick, who reported on the riot and its aftermath. Portions of Ned's diary, set in italic, can be slow going. Greeley lays the Irish on a bit thick for some tastes, but the double plot is rich with detail, while the couple's earnestness and good intentions are never in question. (Mar. 14)Forecast: National TV advertising on Lifetime, as well as national advertising and targeting to Irish publications, will ensure a strong start circa St. Patrick's Day.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.",

    "description":"Though questions linger about just how much Robbins (1916-1997) contributed to the later books published under his name, this posthumous novel moves quickly and is great fun, a roman &#x85; clef reminiscent of his early bestselling bildungsromans Never Love a Stranger (1948) and A Stone for Danny Fisher (1952). Packed with vintage Robbins boudoir scenes, it follows a street-smart youth clawing and copulating his way to wealth and power. Born Howard Hughes Jr., the bastard son of the famous multimillionaire recluse, Zack Riordan comes to Vegas in 1966 at age 12, and 12 years later has become the youngest casino security chief on the Strip. The narrative follows Zack's career as he gets involved in a vicious rivalry with the wastrel son and snooty Vassar-educated daughter of his mentor, Con Halliday, the aging owner of the casino Zack has helped save from ruin. When Zack is unceremoniously fired, he crosses continents to cut deals with Chinese criminal elements in Hong Kong and to parlay his quick wits and daring into enough money to finance his own casino, unwinding from hard days of sordid financial exploits by bedding one beautiful woman after another. Returning home, Zack discovers that he has a son by his former mentor's daughter, and finds himself wondering if he has paid too high a price for wealth and power. Those Robbins fans who haven't already fallen by the wayside will be rewarded for their devotion with this unexpectedly lively offering.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.",
